    "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nafter trying to get WhatsAPI running during 3 days, I stopped just trying ;). At the moment I have big problems to get connected to Whatsapp. I don't know if there is any way at the moment to connect via Blackberry Account, burt I don't think so. The latest information about that were from early 2012 and seemed that they are defifinitly not working anymore.\r\n\r\nAnywise, I also could use my iPhone account. But I also don't get it running. I think the problems I have are created by wrong user credentials especially in the user identity variable. I tried md5 of wifi mac, md5 of double wifi mac, md5 of reversed wifi mac and md5 of double reversed wifi mac. But any try I got various errors. I get the message\r\n\r\n\"'There was a problem trying to request the code\"\r\n\r\nso I think that it is a problem in order of the \"new\" protocol.\r\n\r\nThanks for help\r\nHc Devel",

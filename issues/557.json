    "body": "As proposed in issue https://github.com/venomous0x/WhatsAPI/issues/554, here is a way we can define and document all events in an interface(see: WhatsAppEventListener.php). I added example code in EVENTS.md, but basically the difference is:\r\n\r\nTo add an event listener, you'd do this: (Where MyEventListener extends WhatsAppEventListenerBase)\r\n    $w->eventManager()->addEventListener(new MyEventListener());\r\n\r\nInstead of this: (Although this way is still supported.)\r\n    $w->eventManager()->bind('onConnect', 'MyFunction_onConnect');\r\n\r\nAnd now MyEventListener will be able to handle any event that WhatProt can raise.\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n* Interface to enforce that documentation and code (including method names are arguments) are keep in sync. The documentation will now be a part of the interface.\r\n* Raising an event in whatsprot.class.php will call a specific method in WhatsAppEvent which will also help to enforce that the arguments sent and in sync with the interface.\r\n* Added the beginnings of a unit test framework. We should now run WhatsAppEventTest.php before committing any new code. It will simulate some WhatsApp messages and ensure that the events are raised as expected. (This is a work in progress.)\r\n* All this code should be backwards compatible.\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n* I added quite a lot of code here and it does make the code more complex.\r\n* Adding new events/arguments will require more code changes.\r\n* I didn't do any performance testing, but due to the change in event processing this new way will likely be a little slower since there's a little more work to be done each time an event is fired.\r\n\r\nQuestions:\r\n* What are the actual arguments to onGetPrivacyBlockedList?\r\n* What is our target version of PHP that we'd like to support? (I'm using 5.4 but not sure if I should be testing on an earlier version.)\r\n* How backwards compatible do we want to be? I'd like to remove some of the \"Legacy\" event firing / handling, but I'm sure that would break existing users.\r\n* Why is $event_listeners static in WhatsAppEvent? Any concern if I make it non-static?\r\n\r\nThanks for reviewing. Looking forward to any feedback.",

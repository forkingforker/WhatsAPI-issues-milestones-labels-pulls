Waiting for the the whatsapp servers to reply with a node that contained the messageID (which is what waitForServer method does) meant all messages/nodes were process or received correctly.\r\n\r\nDo I assume you're using a windows box? Perhaps the connections are slightly slower -- giving the whatsapp servers a chance to process the request properly.",

The message would be pushed into the socket buffer but never flushed. That's why I added pollMEssages() at the end of sendMessage(), so that the buffer would be flushed before continuing the script.\r\n\r\n@Bashin @slobo42 so if I understand correctly, you'd like to have the ID of the message you've sent.\r\nI can do this by either:\r\n- making the sendMessage() function return the ID\r\n- adding a onSendMessage event which provides the message node and message ID when sending a message\r\n\r\nVoting starts now!",

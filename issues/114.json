I received the 3 digit code via  sms and used it but the result is always:\r\n\r\nhttps://r.whatsapp.net/v1/register.php?cc=1&in=6461111111&udid=[md5(mac+mac)]\r\n\r\n< register >\r\n< response status=\"mismatch\" login=\"16461111111\" result=\"me=16461111111 code=111\"/ >\r\n< /register >\r\n\r\nIn whatsapp.php, the country code is 2 digits, does this apply to USA, which is just one digit, 1?  Although I tried padding it with 0, I get:\r\n\r\n< response status=\"missing\" login=\"016461111111\"... >\r\n\r\nWhich is correct?  What is the result \"mismatch\" mean?\r\n\r\nOr does it mean that my udid is wrong?\r\n\r\nPlease help. Thanks!",

Security reason perhaps?  \r\n\r\nI did read somewhere that register.php is to SET password, but it doesn't seem to let me set it but rather trying to match it with something.\r\n\r\nWell, I can't get the IMEI of that phone number.  It's actually a Google Voice number. I used that number on an Android emulator to get Whatsapp on it and activated it.  I can see that number appear in my current phone's Whatsapp client's Favorites list too but completely useless.  So, there is no way I can do anything with that number again right?\r\n\r\n",

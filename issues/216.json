Hopefully as the next couple of weeks go on, we get the tipping point where everyone comes looking for a solution...and we find one.\r\n\r\nOn another note.\r\n\r\nIf you install yowsup from https://github.com/tgalal/yowsup\r\n\r\nIts a python implementation of whatsapp. However, you can use it to register your mobile phone number with the whatsapp servers.\r\n\r\nIt'll send your phone the 6 digit verification code, you then add this to the script. The script sends the request off to whatsapp and whatsapp returns the password.\r\n\r\nYou then know:\r\n1) Your mobile\r\n2) Your mac/imei\r\n3) The 6 digit registration code\r\n4) Your password.\r\n\r\nI have done this, but I cannot tell what type of hash it is, it looks too short to be md5 etc. Nor do I wish to post my details online here. Sorry!\r\n\r\nHOWEVER, this will now have DE-REGISTERED your actual mobile phone, so don't try and send any messages using the official app on your phone.\r\n\r\nIf you do, the phone will send off for another registration code and deactivate the password you just got to work with the yowsup script.\r\n\r\nAlso you can't reactivate your phone for approx 1hour due to restrictions from the whatsapp servers.\r\n\r\nI hope that might help someone get started on fixing this.\r\n\r\nThanks.",

But I think with that method (aquiring a NEW password via yowsup) will make WhatsApp stop working on your phone (because the password is specific to a device or randomly generated upon registration). But if you'd sniff the phone's password instead of re-registering with WhatsApp you might keep them both running (of course with the known limitations and disconnects, but at least without re-registration).",

If i start the script from command line or from a browser i can chat with my server.\r\nThe issue is that after 5 or 10 minutes the script doesn't recieve anymore messages. I tried reconnecting (without logging in again) to see if a new socket would help. It still keeps not receiving my messages after a while.\r\n\r\nIs this something with the socket, or with the way we communicate with WhatsApp?",

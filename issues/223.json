Maybe my code is not very good.\r\nI suggest that the msgid should be calculated by the class in the form of non-repeated\r\n'timestamp-msgCounter'.\r\nAlso, I think it is better to send messages without waiting the response from server about the last message sent.\r\nMoreover, I implemented an array called _sentQueue to store the sent message node with msgid and remove the corresponding element in the array if the server confirmed the received message\r\nIf this is accepted, a function should be implemented later to deal with the sent message but the server does not confirm that the message is received. (That is, the messages stored in _sentQueue)",

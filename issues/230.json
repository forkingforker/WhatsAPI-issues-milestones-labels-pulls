With the original XMPP protocoll you could subscribe to presence updates and get notifications from the server whenever the status of one of your contacts changes.\r\n\r\nWith WhatsAPI I can only get the \"last seen\" info which I have to request every time for every user. It also doesn't show if the contact is online RIGHT NOW, only if he WAS online (whereas the original WhatsApp client does show \"currently online\").\r\n\r\nIf anyone knows how WhatsApp handles this I'd be happy to implement it.",

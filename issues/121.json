    "body": "Hello guys,\r\n\r\nI was toying with the Whatsapi.php script and ran into these two errors:\r\nPHP Fatal error:  Call to undefined function getDictionary() in /var/www/whatsprot.class.php on line 36\r\n\r\nI fixed the above error by simply adding a require statement in whatsprot.class.php:\r\nrequire \"decode.php\";\r\n\r\nThe getDictionary() function is in decode.php. This resolved the first error, but then i got a second error:\r\nPHP Fatal error:  Class 'BinTreeNodeWriter' not found in /var/www/whatsprot.class.php on line 38\r\n\r\nThe \"BinTreeNodeWriter\" class is in \"protocol.class.php\" and this is already required in whatsprot.class.php. \r\n\r\nSo, I am not sure why it is not working.\r\n\r\nI am using:\r\nServer version: Apache/2.2.22\r\nPHP 5.3.10-1\r\n\r\nAny ideas why this is happening?\r\n",

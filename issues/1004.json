I just can't get my password.\r\n\r\nI tried registering with the API, but while it says that the message was sent, the SMS never really arrived in my phone. Since this didn't work, I tried the similar feature in yowsup, which gave me the same results. Same thing using WART.\r\n\r\nI also tried MissVenom, but I can't access the link they tell me to enter after I change the DNS.\r\n\r\nSo, I wonder: is the registration process still working? What could I be doing wrong?\r\n\r\nSome information: I tried two androids, and two iphones. WART and Missvenom, only my phone, which is an iphone 5s. I run OSX mavericks, but I also have a Windows 7 ultimate VM.\r\n\r\nMy goal here isn't just to get some help, but also to prevent other developers to waste days like I did. Once I manage to do the registration, I will write a simple article, and send a PR modifying the README to include this article, making the registration clearer to everyone.",

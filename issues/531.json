Can i send text message to multiple recipients? or i have to broadcast that message to multiple recipients as i saw code snippet of SendBroadcastMessage in Issue #348?\r\n\r\n2. If i have to broadcast a message then is there is any limit in broadcasting message to multiple recipients like 25 0r 30? because we have recipients list in thousands.\r\n\r\n3. I have tried code snippet of SendBroadcastMessage in Issue #348 but didn't find classes/DLLs at following links:\r\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/68235039/WhatsAppDLL.zip\r\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/68235039/funxmpp.cs.txt\r\n\r\n4.

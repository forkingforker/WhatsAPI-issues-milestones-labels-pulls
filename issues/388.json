I can get the .../tests/whatsapp.php to send messages and receive message via the command line. But I can't get the ajaxdemo working.\r\n\r\nI entered the target phone number in:\r\n.../ajaxDemo/index.php\r\n\r\nAnd I entered a username & my password in: \r\n.../ajaxDemo/socket.php\r\n\r\nWhat am I missing here. Where does it get my host phone number? Maybe I should add a contact to contacts.php with the corresponding username? Can someone tell me how this is done?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!",

As far as I know it is currently not known how that's generated. But you can use an Android emulator like [BlueStacks](http://bluestacks.com/) to run the official WhatsApp app. Just fill in your own phone number, you will get a verification sms on that number (after about 10 minutes...).\n\nWith that verification code you can set your password (the android app sets it to the md'd reversed IMEI), but that step is also just a web request, *not* requiring that token. So you can then set it to any password you like, that has not changed from the link dominikwille gave. ",

I think that its like a session or hash for make login... so if this is true... Â¿Why this is static? Because if you want run 2 accounts at same time will be use the same nextChalenge file xD.\r\n\r\nSolution. Will we need a method like this in whatsprot:\r\n```php\r\npublic function setChallengeName($challengeFilename){\r\n        $this->challengeFilename = $challengeFilename;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAnd change the lines that have \"nextChallenge\" string.\r\n\r\nAnd at time of login we need set this name with the phone for example (something unique for this account)  like\r\n\r\n```php\r\n$w = new WhatsProt($phone, $identity, $nickname, $DEBUG_WHATSAPP_API);\r\n$w->setChallengeName($phone.'.dat');\r\n```",

I have a number registered through Whatsapp.\r\nIf I try to register this number with WhatsAPI, it works, I can do the trick and login them on my account (and send messages, list contacts etc etc).\r\n\r\nBut, if I come back to the mobile phone (iPhone 5/ios7), and I open WhatsAPP, this suddently stop working and the application ask to me to verify the number again.\r\n\r\nAfter that I have verified this one on the mobile phone, i can't longer login to the WhatsAPI...\r\n\r\nWell, i understand correctly one number can login only on one device (mobile phone or WhatsAPI interface??) not both?\r\n\r\nIf the latest sentence is true, exist some workaround to make it works together? In fact I really need to use the same numbers on the WhatsAPI and in the mobile phone... :-/\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n",

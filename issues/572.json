    "body": "First of all: I am blown away by WhatsAPI, what a great solution it is for me.\r\n\r\nMy Nokia 206 Dual Sim decided tp stop supporting Whatsapp after a browser update. This is the solution for me. A friend (IT-guy) of mine got an shared server and wanted to host WhatsAPI for me.\r\n\r\nAfter some fiddling around for a couple of days I managed to make a form which runs an script sending messages based on the input fields. Today I finished the Emoji-support, just drag and drop Emoji into the message area and as result the Hexcode appears. \r\n\r\nMy next goal is to pull messages from Whatsapp and every 5 minutes and place them in the MySQL-database of this friend. I have no idea how to do that but it will be fun finding out. \r\n\r\nThe problem I am facing is this:\r\n```\r\nWarning: file_put_contents(nextChallenge.dat) [function.file-put-contents]: failed to open stream: Permission denied  \r\n```\r\nI read something about this in an enhancement and tried to use the enhancement, didn't work for me. \r\n\r\nAlso: where in the API is it pulling the components of the messages? If I set The database scraper on there I don't have to iterate through al the echo for a timestamp. ",

In the exemples we just need to use:\r\n\r\n- connect\r\n- loginWithPassword\r\n- sendSetProfilePicture (if changed)\r\n- sendMessage (if want send message, obviously)\r\n- pollMessage\r\n\r\nIn some topics here, long time ago, I saw another things that WhatsApp probably do, and as I want create an web application, to login and use the same way that we use in cellphone, what do you recommend do? Like anothers things, as sync contacts, and if I need sync contacts everytime I connect or just once a day, for exemple...\r\n\r\nThanks :)",

    "body": "I had a number that was previously registered on my device. I wanted to use it with whatsapi, so i deleted my account from whatsapp on the device and tried registering through the api. But every time i try sending sms it throws this error \"no cell routes to send sms for your operator. Please try other method [sms/voice] You can retry requesting code after 1 hour(s) 0 minute(s)\". Same with voice too.\r\n\r\nSame method works smoothly for new numbers, but not for the ones which were de-registered from a device earlier. I tried around 4-5 numbers with same result. I'm facing this problem when registering through api, if i try to register the number again from a device it works.\r\n\r\nCan you help me with the reason for this issue?",

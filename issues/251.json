You might find it funny some people in this world don't know how to use email at all but that is real. We used to email but just cant continue and we switch to SMS were it just popup on their phone. 80% of our worker ( waiter in restaurant) did not finish primary school & know very simple english words and we have to manually set whatsapp on their nokia symbian phone.",

So if your worker has an old pre-Symbian Nokia (which is able to send and receive email), or forgets to charge or loses his phone he's screwed. Email is accesible from any place on any platform, WhatsApp is limited to 1 device per 1 phonenumber.\r\n\r\nSecond, if you use a proper email client it will give you the proper push notifications like SMS. Email also lets you send vCal files which can be imported into the calendar.\r\n\r\nMy personal reason for using this API is to bring WhatsApp to unsupported platforms like Windows for people without a smartphone, or who just want to use it on their desktop. I'm currrently working on a .NET version, but I'm also looking into WhatsAPI for easy web access.\r\n",

The broadcasting messages doesn't works in old clients (using Bluestack).\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this new stage they're blocking with a few message sents (3,5, 15) no limit by messages, (limit by time that one batch process it's executed).\r\n\r\nMy theory (and i've read other people that ask it), it's that every time that we make a login, or we make a send, new password it's returned, and should be updated).\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso i have a number where i've just sent more than 20 messages in less than 5 minutes (to 2 phones of myself), and i couldn't block it... That's very strange..\r\n\r\nMaybe we need to spy again the information transfered between new clients and whatsapi, to see if it sends something different.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnybody nows if this happens only with Whatsappi, or also with Yowsup?  Because if they do fine, we can compare the code with it...  It's easy to migrate from Python to asp or php.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

This whole thing is completely useless if I we are unable to send more than 20 messages out in one swoop. I have an Internet business and want to notify my subscribers (i.e. hundreds) several times a day. That's a very legitimate use and I don't need you polluting this thread on when and why this API should be used. Spammers will use it as well - yes - nothing we can do about that.\r\n\r\nAnd don't tell me to use email. By the way - 1990 called - it wants its hat back.",

With Bluestack we had a pure Whatsapp and it blocked SIMs each 2500 messages, 1250, 500 and at the end 300 messages.\r\n\r\nWith Whatsapi, i was be able to launch between 500-1000 messages, \r\n\r\nIn my latest test some days ago i had two types of responses\r\na)  It blocked 10 SIMs in 5-6 message\r\nb) I send 300 messages with other number without any kind of problem, and was not blocked..\r\n\r\n\r\nMy theory ,and also questions are:\r\n\r\na) There is some kind of check to determine if a message is spam or not to block the sim\r\nb) The number of the SIM can be a factor that determines the kind of checkings to do. \r\nc) Time of sending message is not a significative indicator... I've make sends each hour, with a maximum of 5 messages daily and they were blocked\r\nd) Number of logins is significative????    Should we made a login each time we send a message?\r\ne) In the line of Beldar,  Message have a correct composite?  And the detect with a batch process that are not ok?\r\nMaybe they send a token in the login, or each message, that should be used in the composite of message?\r\nf) Some kind of Black IPs?\r\n\r\n\r\nSorry, i can't help more, only explain my issues.",

The server for group chats is 'g.us' instead of 's.whatsapp.net'. \n\nMy change checks for the existance of a hyphen to determine whether the recipient is a group chat. If so, it uses 'g.us' as the server.\n\nIn case this is not known: The easiest way to find the JID for a group chat is to find the profile image in /sdcard/WhatsApp/Profile Pictures. The JID is the name of the image. (Without the extension of course)",

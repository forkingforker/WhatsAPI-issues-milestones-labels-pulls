Depending on the platform, it uses a different encryption method. If I remember well, there used to be some thread on XDA Developers with some Android decryptors. For other platforms, such as Blackberry, decryption will probably be much harder.\n\nPulling past messages from the server itself is however most likely impossible, because they allegedly do not store them.

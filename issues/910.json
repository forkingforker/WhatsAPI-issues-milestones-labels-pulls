I am only trying to understand how to add numbers to my contacts using WhatsApi.\r\n\r\nAnd the second question i asked, i wanted to ask, if somehow i cannot add any number to my contacts using whatsapi, then, is there any provision to send messages to contacts which exist on my phone.\r\n\r\nBut As you said,If i understand, ContactSync is method where WhatsApp verifies which of the \r\nnumbers are whatsapi or not, and if they are, they will be added to my contact list automatically. I got my answer that i can add numbers to my contact using whatsapi.\r\n\r\nI too dont support spamming, i just want to simulate whatsapp on my browser rather than using on my phone. Sending same message to numbers which exist in my contact list is not spamming, is it?\r\n\r\n@shirioko I don't think i support any type of spamming in my question. I don't know what you understood?\r\n\r\nThanks, @mgp25",

While the\r\n$w->eventManager()->bind(\"onMessageReceivedServer\", \"onServerReceived\");\r\n\r\ndid shown the message status received by the WA server. \r\n\r\nIs there any way I could immediately get the message status sent? Like first tick or the receiver does not have WA account yet?\r\n\r\nI am thinking of getting the message status later after a message was sent but I can't figured out which function I should use. Is there any proper complete documentation for this API? \r\n\r\nCould there any function that return message status for specific message ID like example : \r\n\r\n$w->eventManager()->bind->(\"onMessageReceiveClientSpecID\", \"functionListener\",$uniqueID);\r\n\r\nPlease help. Thanks in advance. \r\n",

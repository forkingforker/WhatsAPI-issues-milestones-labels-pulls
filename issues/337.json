            "body": "I haven't worked with WP7 native DLLs yet. I'm new to Dis# because I can't remember what I used back in 2011 to disassemble the WP client.\r\nHowever, it's confusing because the IMisc interface from the native DLL does not seem to match the function order from the .NET dll.\r\n\r\nStarting at .data:0007A284 are seven function pointers (followed by the GUID for IMisc: \"53a4a6b2-424d-4198-887b-9e8d68fca9c2\"). I believe them to be this:\r\n\r\n6.      sub_15AB0      \r\n0.      sub_15158        \r\n5.      sub_155D0\r\n4.      sub_1531C\r\n2.      000151D4 IMisc_GetString_\r\n3.      sub_15268\r\n1.      000151C4 IMisc_Exit_\r\n\r\nThe first row is rank, sorted by actual function address. Shown order is order in function pointer table.\r\n\r\n\r\nDisassembled using Dis#:\r\n\r\n    [Guid(\"53a4a6b2-424d-4198-887b-9e8d68fca9c2\")]\r\n    [ComVisible(true)]\r\n    public interface IMisc {\r\n        string DumpLog();\r\n        void Exit(uint code);\r\n        CELL_INFO GetCellInfo();\r\n        uint GetHr([MarshalAs(UnmanagedType.Interface)] object hackObj);\r\n        void GetPowerStatus([MarshalAs(UnmanagedType.Struct)] ref CEPowerStatus out, bool bypassCache);\r\n        string GetString(int idx);\r\n        IByteBuffer GetToken(IByteBuffer prefix, IByteBuffer fuzz);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\nAs you can see, Exit and GetString are not at the expected positions in the interface (not by address, not by order, not by type - I can't find any system. It seems as if Dis# just sorts the interface alphabeticly [which would be wrong..])\r\nHowever, I should at least have Exit identified correctly because all the native DLL does is a call to TerminateProcess(0x42, code).\r\n\r\nGetString at 000151D4 is also likely because it accepts values from 0 to 4 as argument and returns a copy from a string-pointer-table string (which, however, seems to contain garbage, *(0x7B59C + idx * 4) would be the actual string pointer I believe).\r\n\r\nsub_1505C is a warning / error print function which passes the string to sub_14F30 which allocates buffers, does printf and then calls OutputDebugStringW.\r\n\r\nIf it was easier to figure out which function is actually GetToken this would be a lot easier.\r\n\r\nIdeas / Thoughts? Who else had a look at the DLLs yet?\r\nI need this so I can actually create a new account..\r\n\r\n\r\n//Edit: Did not know that IDA had support for .NET.\r\nI matched the functions now:\r\n\r\nGetPowerStatus = 15AB0  \r\nGetHr = 15158\r\nGetToken = 155D0\r\nGetCellInfo = 1531C\r\nGetString = 151D4\r\nDumpLog = 15268\r\nExit = 000151C4 \r\n\r\nThis order (which IDA suggests) would confirm my findings for Exit and GetString. So I will continue work on 155D0.\r\n\r\nTo me, it appears that the new token is just a simple hash (using the windows crypto functions) of the phone number.",

I used android-x86 back in November of 2011 when I completed my first WhatsApp hack/client [Back then you were able to send broadcast to the server and only v1 existed, so most of this security is new to me]. In December 2011 / January 2012 WhatsApp then stopped working on android-x86.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt appears (to me) the following happens:\r\n\r\nWhatsapp.verify.Registration.RequestCode will combine \"GetBuildHash + number\" (without cc). Then it passes that into GetToken.\r\nGetToken seems to be a rather thin wrapper around MD5 using PROV_RSA_FULL with CryptAcquireContext function. So far I was able to isolate most crypto imports and now I try to figure out what it actually hashes.\r\nOnce the token is returned from the native part the .NET part will turn it into a lowercase hexstring - so everything normal.\r\n\r\nIt would be great if anyone could provide me with the BuildHash for the DLL shirioko posted. Also the User-Agent string for a current WP7 WhatsApp would be great. At the moment I use one which I made up: \"WhatsApp/2.9.4 WP7/7.10.8773.98 Device/NOKIA-Lumia_800-H112.1402.2.3\"",

            "body": "Thanks for helping!\r\n\r\nI don't have .NET 4.0 in my VM, so no ilspy. Dis# fails to disassemble either WhatsApp.dll (WhatsAppCommon.dll works fine) so I can't have a look at the decompiled 2.8.2.0 BuildHash.Create() as it was still in WhatsApp.dll at that point (it's in WhatsAppCommond.dll now [2.9.4.0]).\r\n\r\nI only checked the disassembly with DILE and it looks to be exactly the same in 2.8.2 and 2.9.4.\r\nJust a SHA1 of the \".rsrc\" section.\r\n\r\nHowever, I'm not able to generate the same hash which is in yowsup using my own tool. One thing I noticed is that mono and windows HashFinal() return different things after calling it multiple times. Calling it more than once will result in different output than calling it the first time [why is that?], but even worse, it's different the second time on each platform too.\r\nThe first returned value is a proper SHA1 though [tested with known plaintext / hash], so I trust my tool.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure why my BuildHash shouldn't work as I pulled it out of the decompiled code + it executes and parses the PE fine.\r\n- Maybe the 2.8.2 in yowsup is not 2.8.2.0 but another build?\r\n\r\nI would have loved to throw my own 2.8.2 buildhash at the whatsapp code request but that only checks the user agent and earlys-out with \"old_version\" so it won't verify my token / buildhash.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo load the DLL yourself you can have a look at WhatsAppCommon.dll -> WhatsApp.NativeInterfaces which is the DLL loader. It will use RegisterComDll(\"WhatsAppNative.dll\", *GUIDs*) to register all the interfaces the DLL provides.\r\nYou should be able to copy the decompiled code if your decompiler is any good.\r\nIf you want to do any calls you will need the proper IMisc interface etc. though. That can be found at WhatsAppCommon.dll -> WhatsAppNative\r\nHowever, make sure your decompiler doesn't sort these imports by alphabetical order but by their order which they have in the file. Check one of my previous posts for the proper order of IMisc.\r\n\r\nYou should then be able to call GetToken already. Signature of GetToken is:\r\nIByteBuffer GetToken(IByteBuffer tokenPrefix, IByteBuffer buildHashNumber)\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how easy it is to debug on a windows phone. But if you have a proper debugger you can probably set a breakpoint in GetToken and jump to the .WAobs section of the WhatsAppNative.dll to check if the token was decrypted. Additionally you can also create a breakpoint at .text:00014C44 which is CryptHashData. At that point R1 is a pointer to bytes which will be hashed, R2 the number of bytes to be hashed.\r\n\r\nCryptHashData will be called twice from GetToken:\r\n\r\n- First time:\r\na) R1 = Pointer to tokenPrefix. R2 = Length of tokenPrefix\r\nOR\r\nb) If tokenPrefix is null (which WhatsApp currently uses): R1 = Pointer to Array I posted above (or maybe a decrypted form of it, same pointer though), R2 = 0x28 / 40 Bytes (Length of the array above)\r\n\r\n- Second time: R1 = Pointer to buildHashNumber. R2 = Length of buildHashNumber",

Yes.\r\n\r\n- S40 probably has a newer version or really doesn't work anymore but server still returns sent for some reason.\r\n\r\n- Right, 2.8.2 WP is known but won't work anymore\r\n\r\n- Right, the token is generated using MD5(tokenPrefix + buildhash + number). TokenPrefix is usually 40 bytes of random data. BuildHash is a checksum of the WhatsApp client (or at least parts of it) and number is just the phonenumber you try to register. The tokenPrefix is known, BuildHash is known and the number is obviously known too. So in theory it should all work.. - but it doesn't.\r\nBuildHash was generated using the actual WhatsApp code and verified by recalculating the known 2.8.2 BuildHash. So let's assume that BuildHash and number are known and correct.\r\nThat only leaves tokenPrefix to be faulty. Upon further inspection of the source while reverse engineering you will find out that the data around tokenPrefix looks like garbage too. Hence the assumption that tokenPrefix is actuallyin an encrypted memory area.\r\nI also found a function which looks like it decrypts tokenPrefix. I now wrote a tool to emulate that specific function.\r\nIt does something (changes it) with the tokenPrefix but it is still wrong. Probably a bug in my (selfmade) emulator.\r\n\r\n- Android was reverse engineered so often in the past that WhatsApp took countermeasures which make the code almost unreadable and harder to decompile. It's easier to work with the WP now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- Using an S40 emulator could work - give it a shot? But at the end of the day you still can't say wether it didn't work because of WhatsApp or the faulty emulator if you don't get an SMS / Call..",

I know.. it's a mess - but it's just a dirty hack, so don't judge the code please:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.jannikvogel.de/scratchpad/WhatsApp/2.9.4-Token/TokenPrefix/\r\n- decrypt.c is disassembly from IDA but translated to C code (Took me a couple of hours and I might have screwed up somewhere)\r\n- arm.h is a tiny emulation layer for flag calculation and memory access\r\n- WhatsApp_* are the sections from WhatsAppNative.dll where * is the VirtualAddress in hex [loaded by the emulator]\r\n\r\nhttp://www.jannikvogel.de/scratchpad/WhatsApp/2.9.4-Token/BuildHash/\r\n- hash.cs is just a wrapper around decompiled BuildHash from 2.8.2 and 2.9.4\r\n- hash.exe also works in mono. Start it with the DLL as argument (\"mono ./hash.exe WhatsApp.dll\"). It will also dump all sections to files called WhatsApp_* for the emulator.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.jannikvogel.de/scratchpad/WhatsApp/2.9.4-Token/\r\n- code.java is the 2.9.4 RequestCode ported to java. Personally, I use yowsup to test at the moment though as both do exactly the same (unless my one is buggy ;) ).\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you want to help you can try checking if my flags in arm.h are generated properly. Also, you can try comparing decrypted.c to disassembly and look for differences or logic flaws / missunderstanding of instructions in my emulation.\r\nIf you REALLY want to help, run this on an actual device and set a breakpoint at .text:00013CAC. Then tell me what you read back at 0x85B48 (40 bytes) and 0x854B0 (String or DWORD, so a couple of bytes - at least 4).",

So, we can use [is_wp_error](http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/is_wp_error) function to check if is an error.\r\n\r\nI think that it's better than use Exception and stop all the PHP code and shows an error in the screen. Would be better to handle with that.\r\n\r\nI know that we can handle this exceptions with `try` and `catch`, but as I said, I think that would be bettler handle with some class to the error. Something added in the WhatsProt class (`$errors[]`) and all errors would be added to this variable, or something like that.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?",

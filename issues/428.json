Make the program behave EXACTLY as the phone.\r\n\r\nThird Option (EXTREMELY HARD but smart and very durable):\r\n\r\nReverse engineer whatsapp (be aware ! the code is heavily obfuscated)\r\nadd an option to bulk send messages\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAs a side note if you are really interested i can recommend you a guy who is an expert at reverse engineering, but is not cheap, be prepared to spend $$$\r\n\r\n",

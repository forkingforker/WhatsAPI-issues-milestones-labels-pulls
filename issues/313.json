The problem is, that both of my web-hosters doesn't support php sockets. So my question is: Is there a REST API out there, which could be used?\r\n\r\nBest regards",

I already implemented a Dialog, which let's WhatsApp send a SMS code and then complete the authentication by sending this code back and then receiving a password.\r\nNow i've got all needed data to connect to the WhatsApp service. I then start a new connection to s.whatsapp.net (port: 5222). But now i have no clue what i need to send in order to login. Maybe you can give me a hint?",

Normally you can only send to numbers that have whatsapp. (not sure how this works exactly but probably you send your whole addressbook to whatsapp and get the list of numbers that have whatsapp in return). So for whatsapp it will be easy to check if there are several messages sent to non-whatsapp numbers. You normally cannot do that with an official client. What do you think?\r\n",

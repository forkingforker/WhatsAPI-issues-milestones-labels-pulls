If i choose my userprofil, i receive an error from google: \"Error: Could not get Authentication code from google\". Next to this i received a google mail that somebody tried to logged in my account. \r\n\r\nAlso there are no other contacts from whatsapp i.e. Anybody know why there are no contacts in my list? I thought the api sync the contacts from my whatsapp account.\r\n\r\nOn my local xampp system i get the following error too: \"Error: There was an error with the AJAX request. XML/Json format is bad.\" Maybe it's not working local.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\nbest regards\r\npaxter\r\n",

You need to know if they can accept whatsapp messages before\r\n * you try sending them messages.\r\n *\r\n * Most of my friends have whatsapp so I know I can select almost anyone from my google contacts.\r\n *\r\n * If you don't wish to have this feature, then do not add the email and email password line to your\r\n * config.\r\n */\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhatsapp does not send you your contacts. I added the feature to allow people an easy way of using their google contacts as an address book.\r\n\r\nBut google contacts DOES NOT EQUAL whatsapp contacts.",

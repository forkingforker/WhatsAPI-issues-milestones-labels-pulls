In which case it stops receiving data and still doesn't send the message as intended.\nI'm pondering a light mobile web client for people with older phones (2.5g with J2ME and browsers like Opera Mini 4-5), but am still struggling with the proof of concept.\n\nCheers.\n\nEdit: Worth saying I already searched through similar issues and none of the presented solutions worked (both replacing some lines in the authentication call which didn't fix it and prevented me from logging in successfully and using this->read(); calls to flush out the messages buffer).",

Even tried python and proxying the connection just to be sure but I get the same result. Will try this from a fully different connection and computer tomorrow and see where it gets me, but it seems I'm stalled for the time being.\nThe official client does work on my Android using the same Wi-Fi network as this PC, so it's not my router's config either.\n\nOh well, I'll crack this down in due time. Until then I'll be open to suggestions!\n\nThanks for the speedy reply.",

It reads:\r\n\r\nWhatsApp\r\nJfh65aXoBLABALBLAgKy WhatsApp internal use - safe to discard\r\n\r\nHope that this piece of information helps others....\r\n\r\nNow I am going to have my smartphone send an sms to my old phone and then I will try to register it with the RegosterCode function, skipping the RequestCode function... hope that will work...\r\n\r\n-> then I receive the same SMS (same code also)... looks like WhatsApp has encrypted the pincode that you receive via sms...\r\n\r\n-> adding this code to RegisterCode results in bad_param... so it's probably encrypted. So not be too difficult to break because the codes used to be 6 digits with '-' in the middle. Anyone has an idea about the encryption type they use?\r\n\r\n-> now 10 minutes has passed and my smartphone was still on the whatsapp register screen. So it retried... guess what? Now it sends the pincode in plain tekst.",

    "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI cloned whatsapi on Debian, using my VPS in the Netherlands. Phone number is also from The Netherlands. I first had some issues due to curl missing but that is fixed now. Registered my phonenumber using WART. Had to install gnome for this on my vps by the way (other x.org would probably also have worked). \r\nThen tried sending messages, both with whatsapi and yowsup. I used a fresh sim to register using voice and a basic phone (first tried sms but didn't receive a message). I can see my whatsapi number coming online, but when I send a message it doesn't get delivered (on my primary phone). If I send a message from my primary phone to whatsapi, it gets delivered, also in yowsup. Sync does also work in yowsup.\r\nI cloned the latest versions.\r\nFor whatsapi I've only tried the included web front, and yowsup only the cli.\r\nThis is because I first want to see it work before I start scripting, obviously. \r\n\r\nWhat could I be doing wrong?\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n",

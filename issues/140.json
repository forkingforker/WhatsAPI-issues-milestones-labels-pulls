            "body": "@beldar The correct way for checking if a message was delivered is to mantain the program running forever waiting for notifications from the server. There may be needed to wait various minutes sometimes, and in case of problems, it may never arrive.\r\n\r\nThe best way to manage this is to create a daemon. When you want to send a message, you send it to the daemon or stores it in an output queue. The daemon should check this output queue and send all the unsent messages. Be adviced that you should not send many messages without reading server response between them. In this responses tehere will be notifications of server acceptance of your message (first check) and user received (the second check). There is no need for \"sleep(1)\" because   PollMessages waits one second for socket input if there is no data to read.The daemon should mark the messages in the output queue and it may retry sending if it lasted a few minutes without server acceptance.... or send it throug sms... \r\n\r\nBy the way: the server has the \"habit\" of closing the connection without advise, then the daemon should re-login if needed.\r\n",

Some idiots figured that it would be a GREAT idea to allow people to send anonymous messages to any WhatsApp user in the world. No registration. No traces.\r\n\r\nThey also decided to monetize the thing by providing an API and basically base their business model on an exploit of a free service.\r\n\r\nThey did not specify whether or not they are using WhatsApi or any other Api on GitHub.\r\n\r\nI already had conflicted feeling when syncing the BroadcastMessage() method into my repository last night, knowing that it would extend functionality for most users, but would also create new opportunities for spammers.\r\n\r\nFor now, I've decided to continue development based off of the DLL files I extracted, but to keep all changes local until I've decided how to go about this.\r\n\r\nThank you for your understanding,\r\nMax",

How about this website? How does WhatsApi prevent their code being used by spammers? Everything needed is already posted and documented. No need to add anything anymore.\r\n\r\nI personally think that spam is not caused by any kind of service (neither WhatsApi, nor WebWhatsApp) but by people. Like: \"Guns don't kill people\".\r\n\r\nAnyhow, WebWhatsApp services costs money, depending on the volume. So spammers are not interested at all. It's a hell of a lott cheaper to spam by e-mail.\r\n\r\nWebWhatsApp was build on own code. Good to know that! Do you really think that what you guys are doing, nobody else can do? Because WhatsApi may become a competitor to WebWhatsApp in the future (when you guys get it all working perfectly), we are monitoring these channels. So far we are happy that it is not working very well, and hey, you maybe better stop posting updates indeed. \r\n\r\nFinal thing: It's extremely easy for a WhatsApp receiver to ban a number. So spamming on WhatsApp is not an issue untill soneone finds a way to spoof phonenumbers from the sender.\r\n\r\n",

So which one is easier to exploit?\r\n- An API where the user needs to provide his own WhatsApp credentials, his own server (revealing his IP to WhatsApp) and his own application to implement WhatsApi\r\n- Or an insecure HTML form which can easily and anonymously be exploited using a basic REST or CURL\r\n\r\n@brittson they are a long way from being better than us, with features like media sending, number checking and message broadcasts. They're mentioning that they have image sending capabilities, but I guess they removed it when it broke after the last WhatsApp update?",

I don't see it as a competition either. I respond merely because it was said that WebWhatsApp promotes spam. The truth is that we fight spam and put a lott of time in that.\r\n\r\nIf 'easiest to abuse' is a subject then we first need to agree on the skills of a spammer.... A really do not agree with shirioko's arguments. In my opinion spammers know how to php. IP adres known to WhatsApp or known to WebWhatsApp makes no difference. User credentials?? I guess you are all using unregistred sim cards, right? Also login accounts with fake names and disposable email adresses to not make much of a diference.\r\n\r\nI think we can agree that in both cases, a potential spammer needs some technical skills. okay?\r\n\r\nTo compare it with the 'availability of guns'. We are selling guns with a license that we can withdraw at any moment whereas WhatsApi is giving the guns away to anybody without any registration.... But even real guns nowadays can be printed at home... \r\n\r\nWe don't believe in security on the client side. So a simple POST form is good enough. Anything else is security by obscurity. Any kind of security on the client side can be exploited. I am not going to talk about details on our system. A captcha is still a debate but so far it is working fairly good without.\r\n\r\nI think its important to understand that we are focussing on (decent) companies that want customer interaction through whatsapp. The anonymous web interface is just a demonstrator. We can turn it off at any moment if we want to.\r\n\r\n@kingofcracking, we are monitoring several projects, just to see what is available to the general public.\r\n\r\n@jonnywilliamson, I have been thinking about that. Maybe in the future. It depends on some things. I see both risks as opportunities in it.\r\n\r\nTo conclude with a one liner:\r\nWe all seem to have the same hobby.... ;-)\r\n\r\n",

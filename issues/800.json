Whatspp would be a great tool to keep in touch with customer who need assistance for solving simple questions and doubts etc.\r\n\r\nThe whatsapp oficial client interface is perfect for the final user, but the person who is on the other side, lets say, an hypothetical customer service professional, would need a better UI, preferably a desktop web application with features like copy/paste and automatic shortcut texts (eg for sending protocol numbers) and so on.\r\n\r\nI totally agree with you guys about the need to keep the service away from spammers, but i think using it the way i described here is very legit. Still i don't know if it would be possible due to the risk of service blocking... imagine lots of people using this channel for communicating with a company... how to handle the responses to everyone without being banned?\r\n\r\n",

Can you please give me an insight on what might have gone wrong?\r\n\r\nI sync all contacts in my list once per session, and then follow the typing - sleep - send message - sleep - poll message process.

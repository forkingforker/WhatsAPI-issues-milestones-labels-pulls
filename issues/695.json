    "body": "Hey all, I've been using WhatsApi since last November with a single number without any problems, I never tried sending a message using the API I was only working on receiving messages from other numbers. However, last week I bought 2 new numbers to use with the API, again no sending messages, and I don't connect with these numbers simultaneously. Today I found out that Whatsapp blocked my 2 new numbers leaving the old one working. Why do you think Whatsapp blocked these 2 numbers and not the old one? Where did I go wrong? \r\nI appreciate your help.\r\n\r\nEdit : I noticed that my blocked numbers were last seen yesterday at 3:05 AM, the exact same moment for both, Where the last time I connected with these numbers was on day earlier than that.",

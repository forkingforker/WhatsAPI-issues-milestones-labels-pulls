When I first tried the -s option to send a message like php Whatsapp.php -s [number] message it was not received (tried numerous times). When using the -i option it seemed to be working. So I changed the code somewhat to not receive input from the keyboard and I removed the loop and then the message didn't go through, except when I put a sleep(2) in between the Login and the actual sending. Today it seems the -s option of the whatsapp.php seems to be working but now my own 'app' (sending an image), doesn't seem to be working at all (while it did yesterday). Am I missing something? I shut my WhatsApp down and I don't see any error messages in the output of the whatsapp.php or my own test code.\r\n\r\nHere's my code (working yesterday, not working today) -> The images exist and the base64 encoding works:\r\n\r\n\t$wa->Connect();\r\n\t$wa->Login();\r\n\t\t\r\n\tsleep(2);\r\n\t\r\n\t$fp = fopen($file_thumbnail, \"r\");\r\n\t$data = fread($fp, filesize($file_thumbnail));\r\n\t$imgb64 = base64_encode($data);\r\n\tfclose($fp);\r\n\t\t\r\n\t$wa->MessageImage(\r\n\t\ttime().\"-1\", \r\n\t\t$receiver, \r\n\t\t\"http://[www.mydomain.nl]/img/\" . $file_image,\r\n\t\tbasename($file_image), \r\n\t\tfilesize($file_image),\r\n\t\t$imgb64\r\n\t);\r\n\r\n",

(I want to make this check before sending a message - I will send an SMS if they don't have WhatsApp)\r\n\r\nI've tried playing around with the function sendGetRequestLastSeen (passing in the phone number) but it doesn't return anything at all - is this the best way? Does anyone have example code for this or another method ?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\nTom",

Problem is that if I send two messages at the same time the bot dies because the other picture hasn't finished uploading. Is there a way to wait to get the script to know that the first media has finished uploading and then get it to start uploading the second one, like in a queue. (I already noticed the media queue in the whatsprot.php, but I think this is automatically enabled and therefore doesn't do what I want it to)",

It is very easy to know if it is a AWS server. \r\n\r\nBut I cannot say that AWS is 100% blocked cause I am using it right now. I just needed to change my way of register a brand new SIM card (now I need first to register using it´s original WhatsApp App before registering in PC).\r\n\r\nAll other readers:\r\nDon´t consider what I did as a rule or a right way to do things. I am just sharing what is working for me. Till today. ;)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

I can do registration, then able to do login and able to send messages to my contacts. But the problem is when I try to use WhatsApp from my cell, it asks me to verify the number. When I do verify with cell and then try to do login with API, it sends me OTP on my cell and thus WhatsApp does verification again and changes my password/identity.\r\n\r\nSo basically WhatsApp, shuts down API if I have verified using cell and it shuts down application if I have verified using API. Is there any way to read a user's WhatsApp password or to generate the same password from WhatsApp API which the application has generated?\r\n\r\nIf it is not then I think, this API is useful to people who does not have smart phones, they will do one time registration and will keep using the interface which we provide them running WhatsApp api as back-end. People who want to use WhatsApp on system as well on cell will have to verify again and again.\r\n",

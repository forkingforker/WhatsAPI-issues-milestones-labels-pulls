Can anyone help me a little out here? I used to be able to easily send messages with Yowsup's chat, but somehow I cannot send messages with WhatsAPI, but receiving is fine for some weird reason.\r\n\r\nI've tried setting up my $sender and changing the $imei to reflect the new v2 auth system, but apart from that I'm getting really tired reading the code and not figuring out what goes where. Could someone provide me a checklist or something of things to change? Thanks a bunch!\r\n\r\nI've set up my PHP and what not already, so all I need are usage instructions, thank you so much.",

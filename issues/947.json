The [Current Timestamp] is the timestamp when the broadcast list is created.\r\n- When you change your phone and re-register to WhatsApp, the broadcast lists you already created will be synced to the new phone and they will be saved with the [New Current Timestamp], not the same as the time stamp when the group is created. For this reason, I don't think that the name of the broadcast list is saved on WhatsApp server, but the contacts in the broadcast list itself are saved there with some unique identifier, maybe..",

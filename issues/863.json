    "body": "Hello\r\n\r\nSorry if this has been answered somewhere already.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to get messages without letting whatsapp think that I did receive them. Basically I want the messages I get with WhatsAPI to still show up on my phone afterwards.\r\n\r\nI was partially successful by disabling the whatsprot \"sendMessageReceived()\" function. Without that function I'm able to get a message multiple times. The issue is, that it still disappears after calling pollMessages() / getMessages() repeatedly.\r\n\r\nAny ideas if this can be achieved at all and if so how?",

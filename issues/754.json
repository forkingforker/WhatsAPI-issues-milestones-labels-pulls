    "body": "Hi! This API works great so far and i am studying the whole day how i can use it for my targets. Basic target: I want to get the last seen or last time online from a specific number which isnt in a group. \r\n\r\nMy first tries with this API have made me happy, my messages which i send to my PHP-WA-ACC are sent and i can see them online. YAY ;)\r\n\r\n(1) But what I dont understand is, how to send a Message to a user who isnt in a \"group\" (also i don`t really understand that grouping system). I saw in the code, that messages are send by the JID. How can I produce this JID to get in contact with new numbers? Or am I on the wrong way and this is not possible?\r\n\r\n(2) Do I have to pretend a phone-memory with numbers and send this to WA-Servers to get a JID? Or is it possible to simply write a function which first adds a contact to my list, get the JID and send then the Message? \r\n\r\n(3) As mentioned before, my simple target is to get the states of foreign user from who I only have the phone number. Is this possbile, or do I really have to make a gmail-account and add this numbers before to the PHP-WA-ACC-Gmail-ACC by using some of googles API`s? (ACC = account)\r\n\r\nFor some hints and explanations i would be very thankful!\r\n\r\nGreets",

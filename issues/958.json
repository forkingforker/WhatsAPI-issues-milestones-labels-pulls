Basically receive a video and ask about their personal data to apply the contest:  Name, email, accept disclaimer. \r\n\r\nAll go fine in the test stage,  but today the number has been published on air and people started to send a lot of messages to the contest and the script stop responding.  When i try to restart the script returns a \"Uncaught exception 'Exception' with message 'Login Failure' \" and can't continue. \r\n\r\nI think i am banned, but what can i do to prevent this situation on future? The app does not making spam, just respond people who talks to the app to complete the steps in the contest.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n",

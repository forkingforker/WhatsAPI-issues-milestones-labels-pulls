Hello I'm mobile +15553431234\r\n3) Whatapps says, ok let me send you a PIN just to check.\r\n4) You get your PIN and type in it. Your phone sends that back to the servers.\r\n5) Whatsapp says, \"Brilliant thanks for that, here's a RANDOM PASSWORD we have just created. From *nothing related to your device*. Please save this in your device, encrypted in a file.\"\r\n6) Phone says, ok thanks. I'll use that the next time I connect to you. Bye!\r\n\r\nWhat we all really need, is a way to just copy/see what the password is on our device so we can add that to the whatsapi script and stop worrying about HOW the password was generated. I don't think it is being generated like that anymore.\r\n\r\nHOW we find out the password saved on our devices is the problem. As far as I can see, only a MITM attack with fake security certificates etc is likely to reveal it :(\r\n\r\nThat's a problem....",

Using fheft's idea I sniffed the SSL traffic using a proxy and I found my password. Also using the base64-decoded pw as password for the session key derivation it generates a valid RC4 key. The sequence is more or less:\r\n\r\n/v2/exist?cc=34&in=64XXXXX06&lg=en&lc=US&id=528404XXXXXX...XXXX62\r\n(Returns error, immediatly continues)\r\n/v2/code?cc=34&in=64XXXXX06&id=abcdef0123456789&lg=en&lc=US&mnc=260&mcc=310&method=self&reason=&token=3da4f4f02255XXXX...XXXb3\r\nVery curious the ID, right? This returns a large code, no idea. After some minutes checking (no SMS; emulator) it issues another request:\r\n/v2/code?cc=34&in=64XXXXX06&id=abcdef0123456789&lg=en&lc=US&mnc=260&mcc=310&method=sms&reason=self-send-timeout&token=3da4f4f02255XXXXXX...XXXXb3\r\nThis causes an SMS to be sent with the code  238-821\r\n/v2/register?cc=34&in=64XXXXX06&lg=en&lc=US&id=%01%c3%91%dbP%ebs%22Z%3d%c05z8m%2cX%28%f5d&code=238821\r\nAgain a very weird ID is sent. Now the server responds with the PW as well as details about the app and account.\r\n\r\nI was thinking.... Maybe we can't (or it's convoluted) isolate the pw generator algorithm, but we could just mimic this sequence we could manage to get a fresh new PW right?\r\nAnyone wants to try? I have my PW and I don't wanna lose it again, installing the root CA in the emulator took me hours... android crap....",

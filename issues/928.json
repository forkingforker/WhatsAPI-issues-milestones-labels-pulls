From the wiki, the signature of the callback goes like:\r\n```php\r\nonGetLocation($mynumber, $from, $id, $type, $time, $name, $longitude, $latitude, $data)\r\n```\r\nI seem to be having trouble getting the longitude part. Sometimes it doesn't have a value, and sometimes it prints an address (probably of the ISP?). Also, what does `$data` variable convey?\r\n\r\nHere's the code of my callback function:\r\n```php\r\nfunction onGetLocationCallback($mynumber, $from, $id, $type, $time, $name, $longitude, $latitude, $data)\r\n{\r\n        echo \"From: $from\\tName: $name\\tLat: $latitude\\tLng: $longitude\\tID: $id\\tType: $type\\tData: $data\\n\";\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAny help would be appreciated. Thanks in advance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Apparently, the signature given in the wiki isn't quite right.\r\n\r\nAccording to this part of the code [1], there's a missing parameter called `$place_name` between `$name` and `$longitude`. So, the variable that I took for latitude was actually for longitude and the one for data was for latitude. It must have been an oversight on the part of the wiki author.\r\n\r\nI'd appreciate it if someone can confirm if my findings are correct.\r\n\r\n[1] https://github.com/venomous0x/WhatsAPI/blob/master/src/WhatsAppEvent.php#L349-366",

For example, first one:\n* `\\x05\\x74\\xa2\\xa3\\x61\\xfc`\n* `\\x0a\\x41\\x68\\x6d\\x65\\x64\\x20\\x4d\\x6f\\x68\\x64`\n\nThis last one contains the nickname preceded by its length (`\\x0a` = 10).\n\nMany of us have tried to change the nickname by replacing corresponding bytes and then changing nickname length and total length to suit the new one. Although completely logical, it simply does not work for unknown reasons.\n\nAnother unexplainable fact is found when splitting the third string above:\n* `\\x08\\x48\\x43\\xfc\\x01\\x32\\xa2\\x3a\\xa0\\x8a\\xf8`\n* `\\x01\\xf8`\n* `\\x03\\x1f\\xbd\\xb1`\n\nAs you may noticed, first string is said to have length 8 but it actually has 10 bytes :O\n\nI'll continue my research on this.",

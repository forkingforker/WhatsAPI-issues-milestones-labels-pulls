            "body": "Hey - I tried this as well and did as you specified. I am also using Android v.2.8.1504 as @ariaveta above, but as you say, that does not seem to matter. I analysed the network traffic in Wireshark and found that, as soon as `$w->Message()` gets executed and the request sent, I receive a [TCP ACKed Lost Segment] message: \n    3694\t897.894890\t173.192.219.156\t10.0.2.15\tTCP\t60\t[TCP ACKed lost segment] xmpp-client > 46793 [ACK] Seq=128 Ack=471 Win=65535 Len=0\n\nWhat happens afterwards, I don't know.. fact is that the message does not get sent. I have made sure that I entered everything correctly. \n\nDoes it work for you and what device account do you have? It might really be because your code, the code of venomous0x only works for iPhone?!\nThanks for the help \nWinston",

The request timed out..\"\r\n\r\nOn Wamp\r\n\r\n\"Error: There was an error with the AJAX request. XML/Json format is bad.\"\r\n\r\nMy understanding is, I need these 4 parameters to be correctly updated:\r\n\r\n1) My number ( Telephone number including the country code without '+' or '00' )\r\n\r\n919971XXXXXX\r\n\r\n2) Identity ( Obtained during registration with this API or using MissVenom (https://github.com/shirioko/MissVenom) to sniff from your phone.)\r\n\r\nI couldn't get MissVenom to work with my Samsung S3 4.1. So I retrieved the identity with exampleRegister.php and WART\r\n\r\nBoth are different, which should I consider, since the string length is different for both?\r\n\r\nFrom WART ( Digits changed for both, of course )\r\nw%8a%a1%cd9%e2%f3%90%89%8c%83%e0g%re%ee%be%83%129%9a%99\r\n\r\nFrom exampleRegister.php \r\n%da9%a2%ee%4ekk%0d2u%bf%ef%15%61%12%30%af%d8%07%09\r\n\r\n\r\n3) Password: A server generated Password you received from WhatsApp. This can NOT be manually created\r\n\r\nExtracted this from WART based on SMS received( Digits changed )\r\n\r\n6Upo2iAM9ZnxIu2Ewy2hQ6eo2DM=\r\n\r\n4) Nickname: This is the username (or nickname) displayed by WhatsApp clients.\r\n\r\nI am entering my last username with Whatsapp.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDIT: Also, when I run whatsapp.php , I get an error message on my phone. Whatsapp can only be used on device, please reverify the number\r\n\r\nWhat am I doing wrong?\r\n\r\nThanks....",

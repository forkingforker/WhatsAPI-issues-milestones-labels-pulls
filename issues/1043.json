Thank you!\r\n\r\nFirst, thank you very much for this wonderful API and to all who work on it :)\r\n\r\nSecond, I have developed an IM application that I need to run from a server. During development, all was done locally (in United States). Once I moved my code to the my VPS (which resides in Canada), all of a sudden all numbers are being blocked. More specifically, the behavior is: First time connect, the login connection status is LOGGEDIN, the second and more attempts the status is UNAUTHORIZED. (BTW, I can get the code by voice and then the password with no problems)\r\n\r\nI have tried the following:\r\n1. Registered US numbers from the Canadian Server, same results\r\n2. Registered Canadian numbers from the Canadian Server, same results\r\n3. Registered a Candian Number from the same city where the server is located in, same results\r\n\r\nBut, from inside the states, all good..\r\n\r\nAny idea what is or might be going on,\r\n\r\nYour help is greatly appreciated\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nBest Regards",

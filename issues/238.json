    "body": "Ok firstly there's going to be a bit of a rant at the start before I give you my results. \r\n\r\nIt just seems incredible to me how many people take the time to find this repository, find the issues section and then without even taking 2 secs to look at the other threads in here - create a brand new issue and ask the same question as 400 other people immediate below them. I'm tired of getting dozens of emails that are all CRAP.\r\n\r\nCome on people SMARTEN UP. You are not **ALL** stupid.\r\n\r\nAlso can we just clear up some issues once and for all.\r\n\r\n1) If you're using v1 of the authentication proceedure (ie everything up until the changes a few weeks ago) and things are still working for you, you are living on borrowed time. Sooner or later you will find that you cannot connect. You will know this by the error message \"incorrect password\". Do not come here and tell us about it, we know.\r\n\r\n2) It seems fairly clear now. WHATSAPP NOW ASSIGN A PASSWORD to each user account, THERE IS NO WAY TO GENERATE IT ANYMORE. You must discover what your new password is, there's no more generating it from your phones IMEI or MAC address.\r\n\r\n3) To those people who have been sending more than 10,000 messages a day and complained about being blocked - I call shenanigans. You are spammers. I HATE spammers, I'm delighted your accounts have been blocked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo as we continue what am I showing you?\r\n\r\nI have finally found away to (easily) get the password for a particular whatsapp account, and I have modified the code in whatsapi to use this password to allow me to send messages again. This solution will NOT help everyone.\r\n\r\nA lot of you will want to use the SAME account as your phone (in my case iphone), THIS IS NOT POSSIBLE USING MY SOLUTION AT THE MOMENT.\r\n\r\nI have been unable to find a way to extract the password from my phone, therefore I used yowsup and my googlevoice number to create a new account and capture the password from there before using it in WHATSAPI.\r\n\r\nHOWEVER when someone finds a way to read the password file stored on the iphone etc we will be able to use the rest of my solution below.  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nHere's what I did.\r\n\r\n**a)** Download YOWSUP from https://github.com/tgalal/yowsup . This is a python implementation of whatsapp and will allow us to register and capture our new account password. You will need a server that has python installed to be able to use this. Move all the YOWSUP files to your server.\r\n\r\n**b)** Edit the config.example file in the yowsup directory.  Place your googlevoice number in the config file. It should look like this:\r\n\r\n````\r\nphone=12225556666\r\nd=\r\npassword=\r\n````\r\n\r\n**c)** run the yowsup-cli file with the following parameters:\r\n````python\r\n python ./yowsup-cli -c config.example -d --requestcode voice\r\n````\r\n\r\nYou will see the connection being made to whatsapp and after a few secs whatsapp will make a voicecall to your googlevoice number with the confirmation code.\r\n\r\nIn my case I let googlevoicemail pick up the call and record the message. I was then able to play the message back and hear my confirmation code. I didn't check to see if googlevoice would receive a sms message from whatsapp. If you would like to try this method, then run this command: \r\n\r\n````python\r\n python ./yowsup-cli -c config.example -d --requestcode sms\r\n````\r\n\r\n\r\n**d)** Now we need to finish the registration by sending the confirmation code back. Run this command:\r\n\r\n````python\r\n python ./yowsup-cli -c config.example -d -R 123456\r\n````\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere 123456 is your 6 digit confirmation code. If success full you will see something like this:\r\n\r\n\r\nstatus: ok\r\nkind: free\r\npw: YOURPASSWORDISHERE\r\nprice: $0.99\r\nprice_expiration: 1359720290\r\ncurrency: USD\r\ncost: 0.99\r\nexpiration: 1388155832\r\nlogin: <YOURGOOGLEVOICENUMBERISHERE>\r\ntype: new\r\n\r\n\r\n**e)** Now take/copy your password, if you like you are now finished with yowsup.\r\n\r\n**f)** The password you have is a base64 encoded string containing your password. We have to now add a way for WHATSAPI to be able to use it. There's 2 code changes we have to make to the current code to get this to work.\r\n\r\nopen whatsprot.class.php find\r\n\r\n\r\n````php\r\n    protected $_whatsAppVer = \"2.8.4\";\r\n````\r\n\r\nchange to\r\n````php\r\n    protected $_whatsAppVer = \"2.8.7\";\r\n````\r\n\r\n\r\nfind\r\n\r\n````php\r\n    public function encryptPassword()\r\n    {\r\n    \tif(stripos($this->_imei, \":\") !== false){\r\n    \t\t$this->_imei = strtoupper($this->_imei);\r\n    \t\treturn md5($this->_imei.$this->_imei);\r\n    \t}\r\n        else {\r\n        \treturn md5(strrev($this->_imei));\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n````\r\n\r\nand replace with\r\n````php\r\n    public function encryptPassword()\r\n    {\r\n        return base64_decode($this->_imei);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n````\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNow you are good to go! To use a very quick proof, create this php file and enter your details, then run the file, you should receive a message after a second.\r\n\r\n```php\r\n<?php\r\n    require \"whatsprot.class.php\";\r\n\r\n    $fromMobNumber = \"12225556666\"; //ENTER YOUR GOOGLEVOICENUMBER HERE\r\n    $toMobNumber = \"09876543210\"; //ENTER YOUR OWN NUMBER HERE\r\n    $id = \"<YOUR NEW PASSWORD>\";  //ENTER THE PASSWORD YOU COPIED EARLIER HERE\r\n    $nick = \"YourNick\";\r\n\r\n    $w = new WhatsProt($fromMobNumber, $id, $nick);\r\n    $w->Connect();\r\n    $w->Login();\r\n    $w->sendNickname($nick);\r\n    $w->Message($toMobNumber , \"Testing123\");\r\n    sleep (2);\r\n    \r\n?>\r\n```",

(10060)\"\r\n\r\nI installed xammp on my local PC and ran the same scripts, they all worked like a charm. I am not familiar with the inner workings of fsockopen and therefore have no clue why this error occurs on my IIS host, but not on Apache. Most likely this is related to the IIS host, though I'm still puzzled by the fact that fsockopen worked to setup a connection to google.com., perhaps someone here can shed a light on this?",

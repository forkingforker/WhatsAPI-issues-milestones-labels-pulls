When you try to get profile picture and has enabled privacy, you get a \"deny\" attribute or something like that. See the output when the debug mode is true, and try to think a solution for that, anyway, this have been answered many times in other issues, i recommend you to do a little research and understand how the API works :) Also you will learn PHP",

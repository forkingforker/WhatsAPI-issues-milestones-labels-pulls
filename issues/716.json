So in that way it's beautiful.\r\n\r\nInsecure? Maybe two years ago when they had no encryption and you had to log in using your IMEI code. I still hear some reports of exploits on Android, but I'm on Windows Phone so I don't care\r\n\r\nNo innovation? Don't mistake a trendsetter for something outdated. WhatsApp was the first modern generation messaging service, years before WeChat and Telegram even existed. WhatsApp was the first of them to implement phone numbers as usernames so you didn't spend weeks searching and adding your friends.\r\n\r\nIt's closed? Plenty of protocols are closed: BBM, Facebook chat (FB XMPP API is pretty much useless today), Steam Messenger, Kakao Talk, iMessage, SnapChat, Google Hangouts (again, their old XMPP API is useless and will probably be ditched during Google's spring cleanup)\r\n\r\nUnstable? Yes it has a few hours of downtime once in a few months. That's a problem you'll face when handling 700.000.000 photos and >10.000.000.000 messages per day for free.\r\n\r\nSo I wouldn't call it shit. It's still the most popular mobile chat service.\r\n\r\n@brittson I intended this API for personal use and not for commercial use",

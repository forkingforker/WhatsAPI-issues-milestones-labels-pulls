I am sure there is no problem with this API, but WhatsApp has started some special system that blocks the numbers. I have tried several things like avoiding checkCredentials(), removing waitForReceipt() and using sendComposingMessage() before send but nothing actually works. Please let me know if anyone has any solution",

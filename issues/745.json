    "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI have several questions about this method. When a user has disabled the function \"Last seen\" when the user is connected does the method sendGetRequestLastSeen() works? Or it does not work if the user has enabled this option whether the user is online or not?\r\n\r\nIn case the method only works (when the user have enable the function to hide their \"last seen\") when the user is online, when it goes offline, does the method returns any value?\r\n\r\nJust to control and display in a client wheter it has enabled or disabled that option.\r\n\r\nEDIT: No, it doesnt return any value and it wont work the method if the user have enabled that option.\r\n\r\nThanks.",

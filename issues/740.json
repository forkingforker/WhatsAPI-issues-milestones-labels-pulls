I was wondering how I can get the 'identity' to use with WhatsAPI.\r\nI checked out some of the code and instructions say that we can receive the identity key by registering on WA using this API but the sample code shown in exampleRegister.php itself required one to have an identity key [1]. I guess I'm missing something. Someone please enlighten me.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n[1] https://github.com/venomous0x/WhatsAPI/blob/master/src/php/exampleRegister.php",

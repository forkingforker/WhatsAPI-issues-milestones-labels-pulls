For new lines I'm using the \"\\r\" in php. \r\nToday I noticed, that it doesn't work on the Whatsapp version of Android (I can't test it, because I haven't an Android mobile).\r\nDoes anybody know whether it's related to the os of the mobile? I've no idea how to fix this issue.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\npaxter\r\n\r\n",

These features have already led to this addition:\r\nhttps://github.com/shirioko/WhatsAPI/commit/11fa519b1734fc10f8140d5d247e875f24795ef3\r\nas well as some other new nodes like\r\n```xml\r\n<order>ping</order>\r\n```\r\nwhich I have yet to identify as to what they actually do.\r\n\r\nRight now I have only a WP7 device and a full time job so I'm not able to test this as much as I'd like to.\r\nSo my request is for other users to give this a try and see if they come across any other new features on different platforms. (You may get a lot of errors in MissVenom.log, she still has trouble decoding outbound (tx) data, I'm working to fix this)\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!",

I'm working on a re-implementation of WhatsAPI using the sources Yowsup and WhatsAPINet (an absolute awful port) - a small sliver of a large project I have been slaving away on.\r\n\r\n",
